Information Architecture:
- IAEntity 
	data:

	methods: list all/highPriority entities, 
	          static list overview content (e.g., /academics), 
	          present long/short/listItem versions (some long versions will have tabbed content: programs; news&events)
	          create/edit/delete, 
	          title, short/long content, 
	          header image(s),
	          createDate/editDate,
	          tags
	          )
